## How To Deploy ZooVanna

1. **Database**

- Set up a MySQL server connection and create a local instance of MySQL
- Create a database/schema called "zoovanna"
- Data is automatically seeded by running the server (with .env value RESET_DB set to "True"). No SQL scripts are required.

2. **Server (Common Backend)**

- Create an .env file in the root folder of "ZooVannaServer", and add the following:

```env
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
RESET_DB=TRUE #True/TRUE/true/1 (false otherwise)
SECRET_KEY=[secretKey]
MYSQL_HOST=[mysqlHostName] #default: localhost
MYSQL_USER=[mysqlUsername] #default: root
MYSQL_DB=[mysqlDatabaseName] #default: zoovanna
MYSQL_DB_PORT=[mysqlPort] #default: 3306

IMG_URL_ROOT = "img/"

EMAIL_USERNAME=[stripeAccountEmailAddress]
EMAIL_PASSWORD=[stripeAccountPassword]

STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="[stripePublishableKey]"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="[stripeSecretKey]"

LOCALHOST_ADDRESS = "localhost"
```

- Replace `[secretKey]` with anything as your secret key
- Replace `[mysqlHostName]`, `[mysqlUsername]`, `[mysqlDatabaseName]`, and `[mysqlPort]` with your MySQL credentials and information
- Replace `[stripeAccountEmailAddress]`, `[stripeAccountPassword]`, `[stripePublishableKey]`, and `[stripeSecretKey]` with your Stripe account credentials and information
- For the first time running the server, leave the value for RESET_DB as `TRUE`.

- In the root folder of ZooVannaServer, run:

```bash
    npm install
